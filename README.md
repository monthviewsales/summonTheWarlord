> ‚ö†Ô∏è **First time using a CLI tool or Solana wallet?** No worries‚Äîthis guide walks you through each step. You‚Äôll need a free account on [SolanaTracker](https://www.solanatracker.io/solana-rpc?via=scoobycarolan) to get an RPC URL and API Key, and we‚Äôll show you how to securely set up your wallet using macOS Keychain.

**summonWarlord** is a CLI tool for executing token trades on Solana DEXes with speed and precision, designed for power users and bots.

### Features

- Lightning-fast token trades (buy/sell) on Solana
- Unified trade command for both directions
- "Auto" sell logic (stop-loss, trailing stop, etc)
- Percent-based sells
- Human-readable output

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/summonTheWarlord.git
cd summonTheWarlord
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Make the CLI globally accessible**

If you'd like to run `warlord` from anywhere:

```bash
chmod +x warlord-cli.js
```

Then add this line to your `.zshrc` (macOS default shell):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/summonTheWarlord"
```

Replace `/path/to/summonTheWarlord` with the full path to the directory you cloned.

After saving `.zshrc`, reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
npm link
```

To symlink the CLI globally (handy for development).

4. **Run initial setup**

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
warlord setup
```

This will walk you through setting slippage, API key, RPC URL, public wallet address, and optionally store your private key in the macOS Keychain for safety.

5. **Check your balance and available tokens**:

```bash
warlord balances
```

6. **Find a token mint address** (e.g., via [SolanaTracker.io Memescope](https://www.solanatracker.io/memescope) or your favorite explorer).

## üîê Using the macOS Keychain

We strongly recommend macOS users store their private key in the system Keychain instead of writing it into any config files.

- To store your key:
  ```bash
  warlord keychain store
  ```

  Paste your private key (Base58 string or full JSON array) when prompted.

- To verify it was saved:
  ```bash
  warlord keychain unlock
  ```

- To remove the key:
  ```bash
  warlord keychain delete
  ```

This helps keep your wallet safe while still allowing the CLI to sign transactions.

## üöÄ Usage

Once configured, you can execute trades using a unified command with only a .9% fee!  Thats lower than any web platform out there:

### Trade Command

```bash
warlord trade <MINT_ADDRESS> <buy|sell> <AMOUNT?>
```

- **`<MINT_ADDRESS>`**: The SPL token mint you want to trade.
- **`buy` / `-b`** or **`sell` / `-s`**: Direction of trade.
- **`<AMOUNT?>`**:
  - For **buys**: Amount of SOL to spend (e.g., `0.25`, `1.5`)
  - For **sells**: Accepts:
    - A percent of holdings (e.g., `25`, `100`)
    - `auto` to let the bot decide (based on internal logic it sells all)

### üîº Buy Example

```bash
warlord trade So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 buy 0.5
```

*Output:*

```
üöÄ Warlord: Buying 0.5 SOL of So1111‚Ä¶...
‚úÖ Buy successful!
   ‚Ä¢ TXID             : 5AbC3‚Ä¶XyZ
   ‚Ä¢ Tokens Purchased : 1234.5678
   ‚Ä¢ New Holding      : 1234.5678
   ‚Ä¢ Cost Basis       : 0.5 SOL
   ‚Ä¢ Unrealized PnL   : 0.05 SOL
```

### üîΩ Sell Example (percent)

```bash
warlord trade FvVJ6RCr1XH8hvZbzx4pH45ab24NNUhWjgTKvGcuVYHD sell 25%
```

### üîΩ Sell Example (auto)

```bash
warlord trade FvVJ6RCr1XH8hvZbzx4pH45ab24NNUhWjgTKvGcuVYHD sell auto
```

*Output (example for sell):*

```
‚öîÔ∏è  Warlord: Selling 25% of FvVJ6R‚Ä¶...
‚úÖ Sell successful!
   ‚Ä¢ TXID               : 8ZxY3‚Ä¶Gh2
   ‚Ä¢ Tokens Sold        : 308.64197
   ‚Ä¢ SOL Received       : 0.15432 SOL
   ‚Ä¢ Realized PnL       : 0.00432 SOL
   ‚Ä¢ Remaining Holding  : 925.92593
```

## üß∞ Config Commands

View, edit, or set your CLI configuration.

### View Config

```bash
warlord config view
```

Displays your current config file location and contents.

### Edit Config

```bash
warlord config edit
```

Opens your config file in your system `$EDITOR`.

### Set Config Key

Supported keys include `slippage`, `rpcUrl`, `swapAPIKey`, and `priorityFee`.

```bash
warlord config set swapAPIKey YOUR-API-KEY
```

Updates a single config key. Example:

```bash
warlord config set slippage 25
```

## üîë Wallet Command

Open your wallet in the browser on SolanaTracker.io:

```bash
warlord wallet
```

This fetches your stored private key from the macOS Keychain, derives the public key, and opens your wallet view in a browser tab.

## üß™ Need Help?

If something doesn‚Äôt work:
- Double-check your RPC URL and API key from SolanaTracker.
- Make sure your wallet has SOL for gas.
- Use `warlord config view` to confirm your settings.
- Run `warlord setup` again to reconfigure.
